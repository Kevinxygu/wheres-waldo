# :eyes: Where's Waldo?

I developed a web game replicating the legendary [line of books!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F)
Play it here: [wheres-waldo-game.netlify.app](wheres-waldo-game.netlify.app)

## :book: Learnings

I found this project on my computer as a dusty project I hadn't finished, and decided to spend a weekend finishing it. Here's what I enjoyed about the process:
| Concept | Learnings |
|:---|:---|
| Understanding Someone Else's Code | This project was from quite a long time ago, and it took me a while to understand my old code. Having grown as a better developer since then, it was a meaningful learning experience to a.) understand how I would have implemented it today, and b.) implement new features in the "language" of another programmer and catering to their existing design. I learned a lot about how to be adaptable as a dev!|
| [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) | I was interested in learning more about build tools, and a friend had recommended Vite. I used it for the first time in this project. It's really fast!! |
| [Netlify + Deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/) | The project was a nice refresher on good practices when deploying a website, and I achieved this with Netlify. I encountered a few hurdles here, but by adjusting my vite.config.js file and having the right settings, I learned a lot more about deploying apps in a good way!|
| [Where's Waldo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F) | I played an ungodly amount of Where's Waldo. |
| Refactoring | The code is old, and I myself had learned a LOT of new healthy practices for coding since then for code readibility and quality. As I refactor it further, it's a refreshing and interesting learning experience as I go. Refactoring the app helps me understand a.) Why does this need refactoring, b.) What would be a better solution and c.) What else will this affect in my codebase? |

## :city_sunrise: Future Features + Considerations
[2024]: Adding more maps + more characters to find! e.g. Wenda, Wizard Whitebeard and Woof.

[2024]: Refactoring the code to be better is ongoing, INCLUDING making it more reactive. The app currently doesn't work if the map shrinks below 900px
