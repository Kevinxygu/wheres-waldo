## :book: Learnings

I found this project on my computer as a dusty project I hadn't finished, and decided to spend a weekend finishing it. Here's what I enjoyed about the process:
| Concept | Learnings |
|:---|:---|
| Understanding Someone Else's Code | This project was from quite a long time ago, and it took me a while to understand my old code. Having grown as a better developer since then, it was a meaningful learning experience to a.) understand how I would have implemented it today, and b.) implement new features in the "language" of another programmer and catering to their existing design. I learned a lot about how to be adaptable as a dev!|
| Vite | I was interested in learning more about build tools, and a friend had recommended Vite. I used it for the first time in this project. It's really fast!! |
| Where's Waldo?    | I played an ungodly amount of Where's Waldo. |
| Refactoring | The code is old, and I myself had learned a LOT of new healthy practices for coding since then for code readibility and quality. As I refactor it further, it's a refreshing and interesting learning experience as I go. Refactoring the app helps me understand a.) Why does this need refactoring, b.) What would be a better solution and c.) What else will this affect in my codebase? |

## :city_sunrise: Future Features + Considerations
[Aug 11]: Adding more maps + more characters to find! e.g. Wenda, Wizard Whitebeard and Woof.

[Aug 11: Refactoring the code to be better is ongoing
